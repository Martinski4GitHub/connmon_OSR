# Changelog

## v3.0.9
Updated on 2025-Nov-27
*   FIXED: In some rare situations, the setting for the ping test server IP address went "missing" from the configuration file, and the value could no longer be modified by the user.
*   FIXED: In some rare situations, the setting for the automatic ping test time schedule went "missing" from the configuration file, and the value could no longer be modified by the user.

*   IMPROVED: Miscellaneous code improvements.

## v3.0.5
Updated on 2025-June-21

    Debug logfile default location: /opt/share/tmp/
*   IMPROVED: Added error-handling code when an SQLite3 database operation fails to create a file. 
*   IMPROVED: When an SQLite3 operation returns error messages indicating a corrupted binary, the error-handling code will now log a separate message to the system logger and to its own debug logfile to let users know of the corrupted SQLite3 and the need to remove and reinstall its Entware package.
*   IMPROVED: Miscellaneous code improvements.

## v3.0.4
Updated on 2025-May-25
*   Moved to AMTM-OSR repo
*   Changed repo paths to OSR, added OSR repo to headers, removed jackyaz.io tags in URL.

## v3.0.3
Updated on 2025-Feb-18
*   FIXED: Errors when loading the webGUI page on the 3006.102.1 F/W version.
*   FIXED: Bug giving incorrect results when computing the free space available of a large-capacity USB-attached drive. This was preventing the user from resetting the database using the CLI menu.
*   FIXED: "Reset Database" functionality on the CLI menu was correctly resetting the database file but the result was not reflected on the webGUI page where "old" entries were still shown as if the database had not been reset.
*   IMPROVED: Modified all SQLite3 calls to capture and log errors in the system log.
*   IMPROVED: Modified SQLite3 configuration parameters to improve the trimming of records from the database and then perform "garbage collection" of deleted entries to reclaim unused space & avoid excessive fragmentation.
*   IMPROVED: Modified SQLite3 configuration parameters to improve the processing of database records.
*   IMPROVED: Modified code to set the corresponding priority level of log entries when calling the built-in logger utility.
*   IMPROVED: Modified the startup call made in the post-mount script to check if the USB-attached disk partition passed as argument has Entware installed.
*   IMPROVED: Added code to show the current database file size information on the CLI menu and the webGUI page.
*   IMPROVED: Added code to show the "JFFS Available" space information for the "Data Storage Location" option on the CLI menu and the webGUI page.
*   IMPROVED: Added code to check if sufficient JFFS storage space is available before moving database-related files/folders from USB location to JFFS partition. An error message is reported if not enough space is available, and the move request is aborted.
*   IMPROVED: Added code to check if the available JFFS storage space falls below 20% of total space or 10MB (whichever is lower) and report a warning when it does. A warning message is also shown on the SSH CLI menu and WebGUI page.
*   IMPROVED: Added and modified code so that every time the SSH CLI menu is run, it checks if the WebGUI page has already been mounted. If not found mounted, the script will run the code to remount the WebGUI.
*   IMPROVED: Improved code that creates (during installation) and removes (during uninstallation) the "AddOns" menu tab entry for the WebGUI to make sure it checks for and takes into account other add-ons that may have been installed before or were later installed after the initial installation.
*   IMPROVED: Added "export PATH" statement to give the built-in binaries higher priority than the equivalent Entware binaries.
*   CHANGED: Modified code related to "var $j = jQuery.noConflict();" which is now considered obsolete. 
*   IMPROVED: Various code improvements & fine-tuning.

*   Pushover (https://pushover.net/)
*   Custom actions (write your own scripts to do whatever you'd like)
*   Healthcheck monitoring (https://healthchecks.io/)
*   InfluxDB data export (if you already run InfluxDB, you can push connmon data to it and visualize it in Grafana, for example)

There are 4 events which trigger the notifications:
*   On each ping test
*   Ping threshold exceeded
*   Jitter threshold exceeded
*   Line Quality threshold exceeded

**Email configuration**

connmon v3.0.0 marks a move to a standalone email configuration that can be utilised by other scripts. If you have Diversion installed, connmon will detect this and migrate Diversion's config to the new standalone location with is /jffs/addons/amtm/mail
connmon will create links for Diversion to follow the configuration to the above location.
